# Simple SVG Brand Logos

## Description

A collection of simplified brand logos. Oftentimes those are only available on sketchy, ad-laden download sites, are of poor quality and need lots of cleaning up. This repository aims to help developers and designers to find high quality logos of any kind in one place. Also, all the color is stripped so they can be used in a consistent manner.

## Contributing

Make sure you have a vector editing tool (like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) or [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator/) â€” I use [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/designer/)) and [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo). Please be aware that by contributing, you agree that your submission will enter the public domain.
