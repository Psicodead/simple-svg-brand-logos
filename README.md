# Simple SVG Brand Logos

## Description

A collection of simplified brand logos. Oftentimes those are only available on sketchy, ad-laden download sites, are of poor quality and need lots of cleaning up. This repository aims to help developers and designers to find high quality logos of any kind in one place. Also, all the color is stripped so they can be used in a consistent manner.

## Contributing

Make sure you have a vector editing tool (I use [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/)) and [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo). 

1. Acquire source vector file
2. Simplify logo in a vector editing tool
  - Constrain within a 64x64 viewbox
  - Ensure there are no strokes
  - Simplify and minimise paths by joining into one curve
  - If a logo can be used with and without a brand text, keep the logo graphic and text in separate layers
  - Make all paths white
  - Export SVG
3. Run `svgo` on the SVG file (`svgo --multipass -i file.svg`)
